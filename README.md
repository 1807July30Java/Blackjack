# Blackjack

Our project is going to be an online game of BlackJack. The purpose of this game is to provide a controlled environment to simulate the classic betting game. Our end users are those who enjoy BlackJack. Users will have their own online identities, with which they can join simulated tables, with an automated dealer. There will also be an ingame currency system that the users will be able to bet in each round of the game.
